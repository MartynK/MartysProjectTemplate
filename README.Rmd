The goal of HUPHAR2024_PK_presentation is to investigate the vibrance of effects of different compartmental models based on public BE datasets using SAEMIX.



As a reminder to myself, at each version bump I nned to update:

 - README file (duh)  
 - devtools::build_readme() 
 - NEWS file (project name)  
 - DESCRIPTION (depends etc.)  
 - devtools::document() your project after defining new functions under /R  
 - devtools::build_site()
 - then devtools::install()  
 - only then devtools::check()  
 
Notes:

 - usethis::create_project() is a great resource  
 - usethis::create_tidy_package() is also great  

## Installation

You can 'install' the development version of PROJECTNAME from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MartynK/HUPHAR2024_PK_presentation")
```

You'd need to have R and RStudio installed on your computer for the full experience. The *.html* outputs are (usually) available in the *vignettes* and *docs* subfolders.


## Further template-like notes

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(HUPHAR2024_PK_presentation)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
