# Infláció - HUF
=======
# Final notes

I consider this project a dead end.

## Why?

I tried to do SAEMIX models with specific diff. models, several of them on several datasets but the runtime was prohibitive despite best efforts.

## What was achieved?

I scourged other packages for public, actual PK data and found ~10 datasets. They are enumerated in *inst/datasets.r*

I have implemented a one compartmental model both by calculating it stepwise and by a *desolve* routine.

## What wasn't achieved?

Didn't wait for the SAEMIX to converge using an 84 obs. long dataset and a one compartmental model. It was 2+hours wwhich was well above my tolerance. I could have parallelized the problem but that would have only meant a 10x increase in runtime, which was not enough for my purposes. I imagine for more complicated models, and for datasets including 1000+ observations it wouldn't have sufficed. 

## Parting thoughts, nagging feelings

I have tried to search for closed solutions for complex PK models, like for specific two or three compartment models and found nothing. The example for SAEMIX is for a 1 compartment model, (sometimes erroneously referred to as a 2-compartment model) but every example and reference I found used the exact same model which was annoying.

Keeping the repo public for transparency, and as a prime example of how to take on more than you can chew which would result in a lot of non-successses.

<<<<<<< HEAD
A project célja létrehozn egy közérthető adatsort és ehhez tartozó appot a KSH CPI adatsora alapján (amit a szerző véleménye szerint elég nehéz megtalálni).

## Összefoglalás
=======
The goal of HUPHAR2024_PK_presentation is to investigate the vibrance of effects of different compartmental models based on public BE datasets using SAEMIX.



As a reminder to myself, at each version bump I nned to update:
>>>>>>> devel

A KSH havi adatsorát átdolgoztam, napi bontásra. 
Az adatsor excelben az *inst/backend/calculate_daily_data.xlsx* úton elérhető.

```{r }
library(ggplot2)
load( here::here("inst","backend","calculate_daily_data.rdata"))

dat |>
  ggplot( aes( x = time, y = cpi)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme( legend.position = "none") +
  geom_line()  +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "2 years", date_labels = "%Y") +
  labs( x = "Dátum",
        y = "CPI (1990 = 100)")

```

## Lokális verzió futtatása

Az appot az ingyenes Rstudio telepítése után lokáisan is futtathatjuk a [GitHub](https://github.com/) segítségével.
=======
You can 'install' the development version of PROJECTNAME from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
>>>>>>> devel

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MartynK/HUPHAR2024_PK_presentation")
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

You'd need to have R and RStudio installed on your computer for the full experience. The *.html* outputs are (usually) available in the *vignettes* and *docs* subfolders.


## Further template-like notes

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#library(HUPHAR2024.PK.presentation)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
